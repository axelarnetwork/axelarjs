Please read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at ${NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL} (the “Site”). 
The Site, made available by Axelar Foundation (the “Foundation” or “Site Operator” or “we” or “us”), acts as an information hub for and a front-end to various open-sourced protocols that operate using blockchain technology, including the Interchain Token Service (the “Protocol”). 
To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services are collectively called the “Interface.”


NOTICE ON PROHIBITED USE – RESTRICTED PERSONS: THE INTERFACE AND ANY RELATED SERVICES ARE NOT OFFERED TO AND MAY NOT BE USED BY:


PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO RESIDE IN, ARE CITIZENS OF, ARE LOCATED IN, ARE INCORPORATED IN, OR HAVE A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW, OR BY DIGITAL WALLETS LISTED ON THE U.S. OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL’S SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS AND BLOCKED PERSONS LIST (EACH SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY, A “RESTRICTED PERSON”).


WE DO NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS. THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE A RESTRICTED PERSON, THEN DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE INTERFACE OR ANY RELATED SERVICES. USE OF A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (“VPN”) OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR MEANS INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IS PROHIBITED.


WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT CAYMAN ISLAND LAW WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY.


All goods or services provided through the Protocol are provided on an “as is,” “as available” basis. The Protocol is constantly under active development, and it is currently undergoing its “beta” testing phase, meaning that while the core features of the Protocol have been implemented, undetected bugs, errors, and vulnerabilities may remain undiscovered until this phase of testing is complete.


The Protocol may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. It is 
possible that we will not detect errors in the Protocol or the underlying technology until after 
code has been fully released for external or internal use. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or 
other design defects discovered in the Protocol’s code after release may result in a negative 
experience for the Protocol’s users.


Users are solely responsible for safeguarding their private keys and keeping such keys 
confidential from others. Because a private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to 
control and dispose of the digital assets stored in the user’s digital asset wallet, the loss of one or 
more of a user’s private keys associated with her, his or its digital asset wallet storing the user’s 
digital assets will result in the permanent, irreversible loss of the user’s digital assets. Moreover, 
any third party that gains access to one or more of a user’s private keys, including by gaining 
access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service a user uses, will be able to misappropriate a 
user’s digital assets. The Foundation and its affiliates will never ask a user for her, his or its 
private key address and a user should never share them with someone the user does not know 
and trust.


Transactions in digital assets performed via the Protocol may be irreversible, and, accordingly, 
losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Once a transaction 
has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer or 
a theft of digital assets generally will not be reversible. If a party is able to hack a user’s account 
and initiate a transaction, the user may not be capable of receiving compensation for any such 
transfer or theft. If there is an error and a transaction occurs with the wrong account, the 
Foundation has no obligation, duty or liability to assist the user in seeking a corrective 
transaction (if at all available) whatsoever, and such funds will generally be permanently and 
irreversibly lost. The Foundation will not be able to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly 
transferred digital assets, and shall bear no responsibility for any such losses. The user is solely 
responsible for providing the Protocol with accurate information with respect to the destination 
digital asset wallet intended for the receipt of the user’s digital assets. If information provided by 
a user proves incorrect, or if the recipient wallet address is not compatible with the intended 
digital asset, and as a result, the digital assets are not delivered to the intended destination digital 
asset wallet or lost, the Foundation will not have any liability to the user for the loss of such 
digital assets suffered by the user.
