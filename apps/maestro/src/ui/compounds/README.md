Sure, here's an expanded version of the markdown file that provides more information on the compound pattern for React:

# Compounds

This directory contains more complex components that are made up of smaller components. These components are typically larger, more complex building blocks, such as tables, modals, and complex forms.

One common pattern for building these complex components is the React compound pattern. This pattern involves breaking down the larger component into smaller, reusable components that are composed together to create the final component. This approach can make the code more modular and easier to reason about, as well as facilitate code reuse and reduce duplication.

For example, a complex form might be broken down into smaller components such as `Input`, `Select`, and `Checkbox`. These smaller components can be composed together to create the final form component, which can then be reused across the application as needed.
